# Vision and Principles (Public‑Safe)

This document outlines the high‑level vision and guiding principles behind the CORE PACT initiative. It intentionally avoids implementation specifics, proprietary algorithms, or internal orchestration details.

Vision
- Elevate reliability, safety, and clarity in AI collaboration.
- Enable multi‑agent/model systems to deliver transparent and auditable outcomes.
- Support ethical alignment and human oversight through clear constraints and interfaces.

Principles
- Safety first: prioritize safeguards, auditability, and user trust.
- Clarity over complexity: favor simple, explainable flows over opaque mechanisms.
- Interoperability: encourage modular adapters and portable patterns.
- Privacy by default: do not expose sensitive data; minimize surface area.
- Public‑safe sharing: separate high‑level knowledge from proprietary internals.

Scope Boundaries
- Out of scope for this repo: internal scoring, arbitration, routing, or orchestration logic; deployment topologies; credentials; internal logs.
- In scope: public‑safe documentation, examples with placeholders, and high‑level diagrams.

Disclaimer
- This document is conceptual and non‑binding. It reflects the spirit of the project while preserving IP and security boundaries.
