# COREPACT-AI-PUBLIC

Public-facing materials for the CORE PACT ecosystem. This repository intentionally contains only high-level, non-sensitive documentation, examples, and diagrams suitable for partners, researchers, and the community.

What you’ll find here:
- High-level overviews of CORE PACT’s purpose and outcomes
- Conceptual architecture diagrams (no internal algorithms)
- Public roadmap (sanitized) and FAQ
- Safe, generic example clients demonstrating how one might integrate with a CORE PACT–style service (placeholders only)

What you won’t find here:
- Proprietary protocol internals, scoring/weighting, orchestration details
- Confidential documents, logs, or deployment secrets
- Anything that could reconstruct internal systems

Disclaimer
- This repo is a polished lobby, not the server room. It intentionally avoids internal implementation specifics, credentials, and sensitive materials.
